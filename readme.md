Customer Manager with AngularJS
===============

### Customer Manager AngularJS/BreezeJS Application

This application demonstrates using AngularJS with $http in a factory as well as BreezeJS in a factory. The factories can be switched by changing the app/services/config useBreeze setting.

#### Requirements:

The following is required to support the backend services:

* Visual Studio 2012 Web Express (free version) or higher - http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products#product-express-summary

* ASP.NET MVC is used for the back end services along with Entity Framework for database access (included if you have VS 2012 express installed)

To get started, double-click the CustomerManager.sln file located at the root of the CustomerManager repository. 


**I'm interested in porting the backend to NodeJS/MongoDB as well so if anyone has any interest there let me know!**
